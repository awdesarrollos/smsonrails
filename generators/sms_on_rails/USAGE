Description:
    Setup Sms On Rails

    The following actions can be specified seperately or together

    environment (default)
      - add the configuration to config/environment.rb
    models
      - copy the vanilla models up to app/models/sms_on_rails so they can be
        edited. By default the models in vendor/plugins/sms_on_rails/lib/models are used
    views
      - create admin sms views and setup restful routes
    dependencies
      - install dependent plugins and gems (enviroment does this automatically)

  Set up the environment and create models in app/models/sms_on_rails
    ./script/generate sms_on_rails setup environment models

  Just setup the environment
    ./script/generate sms_on_rails setup

  Setup the views
    ./script/generate sms_on_rails setup views
